This is a super simple in prompt change calculator. Does not currently process decimals, will soon.

Should process decimals now but still terminates after entering price and amount tendered. changed it to use functions and not need an increment varible. 
edit: No longer terminates, had uneccesary ()'s trying to define order of operations. now runs fine and the math checks out. still terminates if the input is not a number, so i may want to make it so it notifies a unacceptable input has been entered and just restars, but it is functional now.
